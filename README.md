# [ICASSP 2023] Regularization of neural network output distribution applied to speaker recognition

Regularization of neural network output distribution applied to speaker recognition (Pierre-Michel Bousquet and Mickael Rouvier, ICASSP 2023)

## Overview

In this repository, we provide an implementation of JeyffreyLoss in PyTorch. JeffreyLoss is loss function based on Jeffreys distance.
