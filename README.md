# [ICASSP 2023] Jeffreys divergence-based regularization of neural network output distribution applied to speaker recognition

Jeffreys divergence-based regularization of neural network output distribution applied to speaker recognition (Pierre-Michel Bousquet and Mickael Rouvier, ICASSP 2023)

## Overview

In this repository, we provide an implementation of JeyffreysLoss in PyTorch. JeffreysLoss is loss function based on Jeffreys distance.
